## My process

### Built with

- BEM CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned about the position properties. When I wanted to place the button of the dice outside the container, I discovered the power of the positions properties

```css
/* button */
.button {
  position: absolute;
  cursor: pointer;
  top: 90%;
  left: 41%;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [How to Stack Elements in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-stack-elements-in-css/) - This helped me for positioning the button.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
